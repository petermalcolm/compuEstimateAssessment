The compuEstimateAssessment is a step-type for WISE and WISEngineering.

It presents students with an estimation problem and requires that they explain the steps they have used to generate an estimate for that problem.

There is a place for students to describe in words, in numbers and symbols, the estimates and adjustments they make.  The numbers and symbols are validated to make sure they are parsable math expressions (to make analysis easier).

NOTE: For users of this step-type, please add a brief problem name to the JSON file for the node.  This will get stored in each database entry for that problem's stepwork.  This is also designed to make analysis easier.
